# Pizzaria_Website
Creating a Pizzaria website, this is to train my design skills before jumping fully into React.js.
This project main learning technologies will be HTML and CSS as I will dive deeper into -
Creating the right website frame, CSS animation and Design. There will be a bit of js but It will just
basic.
So first I will style the whole website on Figma to see how it looks, with contents and everything.
And then I will figure out how to transfer it here using HTML and CSS. 
NOTE: This is my final design project for now because I will start learning React.js after I finish this.
Also the files will just be here till I finish the design on Figma, then I will upload it here so I 
can look it up whenver I need to.
